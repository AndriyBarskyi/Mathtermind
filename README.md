## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9 or higher
- Git
- Make (optional, for using Makefile commands)

### Installation

#### Automatic Setup (Recommended)

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Mathtermind.git
   cd Mathtermind
   ```

2. **Using Make** (if available):
   ```bash
   make setup
   ```
   
   Or using the setup script directly:
   ```bash
   python setup.py
   ```
   
   This will:
   - Create a virtual environment
   - Install dependencies
   - Set up the database
   - Create a `.env` file

3. **Activate the virtual environment**:
   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS/Linux:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

4. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   make run
   ```
   
   Or:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

#### Manual Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Mathtermind.git
   cd Mathtermind
   ```

2. **Set up the virtual environment**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

3. **Activate the virtual environment**:
   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS/Linux:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

4. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. **Create a .env file**:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

6. **Set up the database**:
   ```bash
   python db_manage.py init
   python db_manage.py seed
   ```

7. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Database

Mathtermind uses SQLite for data storage, with SQLAlchemy as the ORM and Alembic for database migrations. The database file is stored in the `data` directory.

For detailed information about database management, see [DATABASE.md](DATABASE.md).

### Database Management

The project includes a database management tool (`db_manage.py`) that provides a command-line interface for common database operations:

```bash
# Initialize the database with the latest schema
python db_manage.py init

# Run all pending migrations
python db_manage.py migrate

# Seed the database with sample data
python db_manage.py seed

# Reset the database (drop all tables and recreate)
python db_manage.py reset

# Show the current migration status
python db_manage.py status

# Create a new migration
python db_manage.py create_migration "Description of changes"
```

## Database Models

Mathtermind uses a PostgreSQL database with the following core models:

- **User**: Stores student information, progress metrics, and authentication details.
- **Course**: Contains educational modules for math and informatics topics.
- **Lesson**: Individual learning units within courses.
- **Content**: Unified content model with specialized subtypes:
  - **TheoryContent**: Explanatory text and media for concepts.
  - **ExerciseContent**: Practice exercises for reinforcement.
  - **AssessmentContent**: Formal assessments and quizzes.
  - **InteractiveContent**: Interactive elements like simulations.
- **UserContentProgress**: Tracks user progress through individual content items.
- **LearningTool**: Base model for educational tools with specialized subtypes:
  - **MathTool**: Mathematical tools like calculators and graphing utilities.
  - **InformaticsTool**: Programming and algorithm visualization tools.
- **UserToolUsage**: Records how users interact with learning tools.
- **Achievement**: Gamification elements to reward learning milestones.
- **PersonalBest**: Tracks personal best performances for self-improvement.
- **LearningGoal**: User-defined learning goals and targets.
- **LearningRecommendation**: Personalized recommendations for learning paths.
- **LearningSession**: Records of individual study sessions.
- **StudyStreak**: Tracks consistency in learning habits.
- **Resource**: Educational materials like videos, documents, and links.
- **Tag**: Categorization system for courses and lessons.

The database is designed to support adaptive learning by tracking user performance, strengths, and weaknesses to personalize the learning experience.
